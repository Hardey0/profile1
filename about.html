<section data-testid="test-about-bio">
  <h2>My Story</h2>
  <p>
    Hi there! I'm a Computer Engineering student who's deeply curious about how technology works beneath the surface. 
    My interest in programming began with a desire to understand how intelligent systems function — from simple web 
    interactions to the growing world of Artificial Intelligence.
  </p>
  <p>
    Along the way, I've explored the fundamentals of AI, experimented with small model training, and learned how to 
    integrate AI tools into real projects. These experiences opened my eyes to how powerful and creative technology 
    can be when used thoughtfully.
  </p>
  <p>
    Beyond AI, I'm passionate about frontend development — bringing ideas to life through clean, interactive, and 
    user-friendly designs. I love challenges that push me to think critically and find smarter ways to solve problems.
  </p>
  <p>
    When I'm not coding, you'll probably find me reading manhwa, learning something new, or brainstorming creative 
    project ideas. I see every project as a new opportunity to grow, explore, and build something meaningful.
  </p>
</section>


   <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
  <h2>My Goals</h2>
  <p>
    My main goal is to become a skilled <strong>Full-Stack Developer</strong> who can build complete, scalable, and intelligent web applications. 
    I'm passionate about understanding both the frontend and backend — how everything connects — and eventually mastering the art of creating 
    systems that integrate Artificial Intelligence seamlessly into everyday projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm currently focused on sharpening my <strong>JavaScript</strong> skills and exploring as many frameworks as possible to gain at least a 70% 
    mastery of their concepts. I believe in learning through practice, so I constantly challenge myself with real-world problems and personal projects.
  </p>
  <p>
    Collaboration is something I value deeply. I want to work with other passionate developers to build one of the best portfolios possible — 
    one that reflects creativity, innovation, and consistent growth. Every project I take on is a chance to improve, share knowledge, and learn 
    something new from others.
  </p>
  <p>
    In the long run, I hope my work makes a positive impact — creating tools, websites, and AI-driven experiences that inspire others to explore 
    technology fearlessly and realize that great ideas can come from anyone willing to learn and build.
  </p>

  <section data-testid="test-about-confidence">
  <h2>Areas Where I'm Building Confidence</h2>
  <p>
    Growth for me starts with being honest about the areas I'm still learning and improving. I've realized that while I enjoy 
    the logic and problem-solving side of programming, there are parts of development where I'm still building my confidence.
  </p>

  <h3>Technical Areas</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Backend Development:</strong> I'm currently focusing on understanding how servers, databases, and APIs work together. 
      It's a new area for me, but one I find exciting and challenging.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>React:</strong> I understand the basics, but managing complex states and component structures can sometimes be confusing. 
      I'm working to strengthen my skills through practice and building real projects.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Frontend Design:</strong> I've learned that design isn't really where my passion lies. I can build solid, functional 
      interfaces, but the creative design aspect doesn't excite me as much. I sometimes lose confidence when comparing my designs 
      to what AI or professional designers can produce — but I'm learning to focus on my strengths in logic and functionality instead.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Personal Growth</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Public Speaking:</strong> I sometimes find it difficult to express my thoughts clearly in front of others, but I'm 
      slowly improving by sharing ideas and participating in discussions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Consistency:</strong> Staying consistent every day can be tough, especially when results don't show immediately. 
      I'm learning to trust the process and focus on steady progress instead of perfection.
    </li>
  </ul>

<section data-testid="test-about-future-note">
  <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p>
      Hey future me — if you’re reading this, I hope you’ve become that full-stack developer you dreamed of, 
      built your own AI projects, and landed the job you once thought was out of reach. 
      You’ve worked hard to get here, so don’t forget to appreciate how far you’ve come.
    </p>
  </div>
  <p>
    There were days when you felt uncertain, when progress seemed slow, or when things didn’t go as planned. 
    But you kept showing up — line after line of code, late nights, endless debugging — and that’s what made the difference. 
    Remember: you didn’t give up when it was hard, and that’s why you’re here now.
  </p>
  <p>
    Keep grinding until it works out, just like you always said. 
    Keep learning, keep exploring, and never stop pushing your limits. 
    The world of technology is always evolving, and so should you.
  </p>
  <p>
    And never forget why you started — to prove to yourself that you can build something real 
    from pure logic and creativity. That passion is your greatest strength.
  </p>
</section>


 <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
  <h2>Additional Thoughts & Reflections</h2>

  <h3>On Learning</h3>
  <p>
    I learn best by combining research, tutorials, and hands-on practice. I spend a lot of time watching coding videos on YouTube, 
    reading online resources, and experimenting with what I learn. I also attended a coding academy for three months to strengthen 
    my skills and gain real-world experience. For me, learning isn’t just about following steps — it’s about understanding how and why things work.
  </p>

  <h3>On Community</h3>
  <p>
    I really enjoy connecting with other developers. Being part of the developer community helps me learn faster and stay motivated. 
    I believe that sharing ideas, asking questions, and helping others is one of the best ways to grow as a programmer.
  </p>

  <h3>On Work-Life Balance</h3>
  <p>
    I often find myself learning even during my resting time. Coding doesn’t feel like work to me — it’s something I enjoy doing. 
    I like spending my free time exploring new topics, improving my skills, or experimenting with something I just learned.
  </p>

  <h3>On Failure and Growth</h3>
  <p>
    I’ve learned that every mistake is a lesson. Instead of feeling bad when things don’t work out, I try to figure out what went wrong 
    and learn from it. Each bug, error, or failed project helps me grow and become better at what I do.
  </p>

  <div class="highlight-box">
    <p>
      The more I learn, the more I realize that growth doesn’t come from perfection — it comes from trying, failing, and trying again. 
      Every line of code, every challenge, every lesson is shaping me into the developer I’m becoming.
